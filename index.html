        <h1>Welcome to JulesNET!</h1>
        <h2>The Internet of Yesterday.</h2>

        <br><br>

        <p>JulesNET 2000 was founded in 1995 in Palo ALto, CA by visionnary Julien Beckett.
        It was developed as a simple yet powerful solution to the imminent Y2K bug. The fix was
        beautiful in its simplicity: since advancing to the year 2000 would cause every computer
        in America to crash, why not stay in 1999 forever?
        </p>

        <p>There is nothing in the laws of physics that would prevent humanity from staying in 
        the calendar year 1999 forever. Yet, the idea was not well received and people all over the 
        world protested the idea. That's when JulesNET 3000 was born. Since history repeats itself,
        there is no reason to believe there would not be a Y3k bug, except this time we have a 
        thousand years to prepare.
        </p>
